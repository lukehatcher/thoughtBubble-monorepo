## background & tech stack
ThoughtBubble is an React Native application. It pairs with the [ThoughtBubble VSCode extension](https://github.com/lukehatcher/vscode-todo-extension) in order to sync and display your thoughts/ideas/notes across the mobile and desktop applications. The server is built with Node.js and Express.js and connected to a MongoDB store. The VSCode extension is built with TypeScript and React.


## inspiration
I built this project to help centralize my ideas for projects I was working on. Rather than having these thought and ideas scattered across varios slack messages, txt files, code comments, google docs, smartphone notes etc... this allows me to bubble them all together. Away from your computer and thinking about that one pesky bug? Put a note in the app and have it waiting for you directly in your code editor when you get back to your computer.
